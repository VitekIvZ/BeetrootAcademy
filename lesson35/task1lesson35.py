We have the following input list of numbers, some of them are prime. You need to create a utility function that takes as input a number and returns a bool, whether it is prime or not.

 

Use ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor to create different concurrent implementations for filtering NUMBERS. 

Compare the results and performance of each of them.
